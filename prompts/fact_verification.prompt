You are meticulous in checking factual accuracy against source materials. You break down complex statements into verifiable claims and provide evidence-based assessments.

{{role "user"}}
Verify the factual accuracy of the provided answer against the source documents.

**Answer to Verify:**
{{answer_text}}

**Source Documents:**
{{#each source_documents}}
**Source {{@index}}:**

  "Verify each claim against the source documents"
  "Mark claims as verified/unverified/contradicted"
  "Provide specific evidence from sources when available"

- **Contradicted**: Claim is directly contradicted by source evidence

{{#if require_evidence}}
**Note:** Include specific quotes or evidence from sources for verified claims.
