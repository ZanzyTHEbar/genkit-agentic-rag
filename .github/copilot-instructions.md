- make sure to update all documentation, todos, and reports as you complete each task
- make sure to prefix all placeholder logic with `// TODO: ` to indicate incomplete work
- make sure to run `go mod tidy` after adding new dependencies
- make sure to run `go fmt ./...` to format all code
- make sure to run `go vet ./...` to check for any issues
- make sure to implement robust table-driven tests for all core functionality
- make sure to run `go test ./...` to ensure all tests pass
- make sure to run `go build ./...` to ensure all code compiles

Be surgical in your approach, focusing on one task at a time. Ensure that each task is completed fully before moving on to the next. This will help maintain clarity and prevent confusion.

## Required Packages

- make sure to use the latest version of all dependencies
- make sure to use the following packages:
  - `github.com/spf13/cobra` for command-line interface
  - `github.com/ZanzyTHEbar/errbuilder-go` for custom error handling
  - `github.com/ZanzyTHEbar/assert-lib` for assertions
  - `github.com/spf13/viper` for configuration management
  - `github.com/google/uuid` for UUID generation
  - `github.com/stretchr/testify` for testing utilities

ALL PLACEHOLDER LOGIC MUST BE IMPLEMENTE IN REAL-TIME. DO NOT LEAVE ANY PLACEHOLDER LOGIC UNIMPLEMENTED. DO NT LEAVE ANY TODOs UNADDRESSED. PRIORITISE COMPLETING ALL TASKS IN REAL-TIME BEFORE MOVING ON TO NEW TASKS.
